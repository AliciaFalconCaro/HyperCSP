**Abstract:** This work proposes a new formulation for common spatial patterns (CSP), often used as a powerful feature extraction technique in brain-computer interfacing (BCI) and other neurological studies. In this approach, applied to multiple subjects’ data and named as hyperCSP, the individual covariance and mutual correlation matrices between multiple simultaneously recorded subjects’ electroencephalograms are exploited in the CSP formulation. This method aims at effectively isolating the common motor task between multiple heads and alleviate the effects of other spurious or undesired tasks inherently or intentionally performed by the subjects. This technique can provide a satisfactory classification performance while using small data size and low computational complexity. By using the proposed hyperCSP followed by support vector machines classifier, we obtained a classification accuracy of 81.82% over 8 trials in the presence of strong undesired tasks. We hope that this method could reduce the training error in multi-task BCI scenarios. The recorded valuable motor-related hyperscanning dataset is available for public use to promote the research in this area.
